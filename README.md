# Project_Trade-Ahead
An Unsupervised Learning project related to "Trade - Ahead" involves using unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze stock market data, likely for a financial consultancy firm named Trade-Ahead.

Objective To preprocess the raw data, analyze it, and build a unsupervised Machine Learning model to: 

* Cluster various companies stocks as per their characteristics.
* Recommend actionable insights and business recommendations based on the clustered data
* Clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering are commonly used to group stocks with similar attributes (e.g., current price, price change, volatility, return on equity)

Skills and Tools:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable identification, Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis)
* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Cluster Profiling
